# Assessing Security Culture
Assignments from UofMN Cybersecurity Bootcamp
Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture

This week we learned about security culture and how to promote it within organizations. 
It’s important that all employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyberattacks aim to exploit human weaknesses with methods like phishing.
For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses.
Scenario
Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work.


Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones.


Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.


Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications.


You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.
Instructions 
Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
Answer the following questions:
Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
Phone theft Data theft/leakage, data in the wrong hands. 
Downloading malicious apps or sites 
Phishing emails
Public exposure to an insecure network. 

	


Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
Phone theft/Data leakage. Data in the wrong hands. 
Having location on at all times, enable tracking and ability to wipe the phone clean of data if it’s lost. 
Requiring 6-digit password, face recognition, fingerprint
Downloading malicious apps or sites 
Downloading only trusted apps and visiting reputable websites. 
Phishing emails
Only downloading attachments or clicking links from known and trusted senders. 
Public exposure to an unsecure network
Log into VPN when in public. Opting for using your personal hotspot when secure network is not available. 


For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.
What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
Phone theft Data theft/leakage, data in the wrong hands. 
Conduct a survey to see who has their location enabled?
Take screenshot and send email to confirm. 
Phishing emails that can. 
Conduct phishing tests once a quarter to see how many employees fall for the bait. 
Public exposure to an insecure network.
Look up how often a VPN is being used?
Conduct a survey to see how often people use a VPN when in public. Do you connect to insecure networks?
For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.
What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?
Phone theft Data theft/leakage, data in the wrong hands. 
100% of employees have data enabled 90% of the time. 
Downloading malicious apps or sites 


Phishing emails that can. 
Under 5% download/click rate of suspicious emails. 
Public exposure to an insecure network. 
Use of VPN in public places, 75% of the time. 


For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.
Step 2: Involve the Right People
Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.
HR - Human Resources will be responsible for creating and delivering the training materials. They need to create policies documentation and paperwork for staff to sign both for current and new hires. They also need to make sure everyone understands the importance of these policies and answer any questions or concerns they have. 
Management - Management will be held responsible for making sure their direct reports follow the new policies and procedures. They act as champions of change and lead teams by example. They are held responsible to report any suspicious behavior to HR. 
IT - Responsible for conducting surveys and phishing tests to gather information and create reports of whether or not the new policies are being followed. They are responsible for addressing risks as they arise and reporting information updates to the other departments. 
Employees - Responsible for abiding by the new policies and procedures at all times. They should attend training and stay up to date with new policies. If they have questions about policies it is their responsibility to ask for clarity. 
CEO - Responsible for approving funding for all aspects of the new policies and procedures, including the training, departments required to assist, and testing/surveying the results as needed. The CEO is also responsible for giving the overall go-ahead for the project.



Step 3: Training Plan






AGENDA 
Training Objectives:
The purpose of this training is to inform all employees on the possible cybersecurity risks and attacks they face on a daily basis. A goal of under 5% click-rate of suspicious email attachments is expected after this training is complete. 
The purpose of this presentation will be so that employees understand the importance of adhering to the new policies and procedures and feel comfortable using the resources and tips they’ve been given to stay safe online. This training will assist in decreasing risks of attack by increasing knowledge of how these attacks happen and how easy it is for data to be stolen. This new and applied knowledge will decrease the loss of sensitive/confidential data long-term. 
Training Logistics:
This training will be mandatory for all employees. 
Training will run every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months after that. 
Training will be mandatory in-person for the first time and can be completed online for each training that follows. 
One-on-one assistance following the training will be provided on an as-needed basis.
For new hires, the initial training will be completed during their orientation with HR.
Employees will be given 1 month to complete their initial training. 

Topics Covered:
The majority of this training will be a presentation by the IT department of the risks of attack that employees face. These risks include:
Phishing emails 
Insecure networks, coffee shops, grocery stores, airports, etc.
Loss or stolen phones
How to recognize trusted sources 
Creating strong passwords, 2FA
Assessing Effectiveness/Next Steps 
Following the training, the Kirkpatrick’s Four-Level Training Evaluation Model will be used to identify how effective this training was. This evaluation model will evaluate the reaction, learning, behavior, and impact that this training had on those who participated. Detailed evaluation measures are as follows: 
Reaction - How did the participants react to the training?
Participants will complete a questionnaire immediately following the training: 
Qualitative: Questions will be open-ended to provide qualitative/valuable feedback. 
Quantitative: ex. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this training?
Learning - Ensuring the training has met the intended objectives:
Use quizzes and evaluations to identify what employees know
Can employees confidently identify a phishing email?
Knows how to enable location on their phone 
Can effectively use VPN in public 
Knows how to strengthen passwords and set up 2FA on phone and other accounts
Behaviour - Through observations and reviews changed behaviors will be tested through phishing emails before and after training.
Phishing emails will be sent to employees before and after attending training. 
Impact - Evaluate how comfortable employees feel after a few months of receiving phishing emails. 
Interviews/1-on-1 discussions
Questionnaire to measure perceptions
Analyzing results of phishing emails clicked 
Follow-up training with quizzes will be required for employees on a semiannual basis. Employees who score under 80% on quizzes will be required to attend an additional in-person training.
